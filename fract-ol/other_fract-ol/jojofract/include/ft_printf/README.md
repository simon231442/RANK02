ft_printf: Recreating printf at 42

The ft_printf project challenges 42 school students to implement their own version of the iconic printf function from the C standard library. This project serves as a deep dive into string formatting, variadic functions, and low-level I/O operations.
Project Objectives
- Create a library that includes a custom printf function
- Handle essential format specifiers: %c, %s, %p, %d, %i, %u, %x, %X, and %%
- Implement basic flag and field width management
- Utilize variadic functions and associated macros (va_start, va_arg, va_copy, va_end)
  
Key Learning Outcomes
- Advanced String Manipulation: Students learn to parse and process complex format strings efficiently.
- Variadic Functions: The project introduces the concept of functions with a variable number of arguments, a powerful C programming technique.
- Memory Management: Proper handling of different data types and their representations in memory is crucial for accurate output.

Low-Level I/O: Students gain experience with system calls for output, enhancing their understanding of how programs interact with the operating system.
Code Modularity: Implementing printf requires breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable functions, promoting clean and organized code.

By successfully completing ft_printf, students not only recreate a fundamental C library function but also significantly enhance their C programming skills and understanding of core language concepts12.
